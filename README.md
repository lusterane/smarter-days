Facebook Machine Learning/AI (NLP) Hack-a-thon submission

## Goal

We want to enable people to reach their goals and maintain a healthy work/study and life balance.

## What?

I'm working with my good friend [Richard Lin](https://github.com/rlin04) to create a submission for this [Facebook Hackathon](https://fbai2.devpost.com/). It requires that participants interact with their Wit.ai platform and find creative solutions for solve real-world problems.

Our solution is a productivity web application we call [smarter days](https://smarter-days.web.app/).

## How?

We have been training a NLP model to understand phrases that align with a broad range of activities. Users will enter/say their activities throughout the day and the web app will provide metrics for the users.

Also, I have been developing the full-stack web application that users will interface our model with.

## When?

Deadline is **5:00pm EDT Jun 24, 2020**.
The project will be finished then.
